Hi, 

Thanks for checking out Handset Detection. This is a Readme file 
for the Handset Detection HD3 API Kit, which implements version 3
of our API.

There are 2 ways you can use our device detection service, they are
by Javascript or by API Kit.

Javascript involves pasting a small javascript code snippet into the 
<head> section of your web pages. Its simple, painless, quick and easy 
to do. It doesnt need any technical skills apart from cut and paste. 
If you're using this method then you dont need this API Kit at all. 
Simply login, add a new 'Site Profile' and follow the prompts.

API Kits are more technical and are targeted at folks that have high 
traffic volumes or their own developers. Generally when a new visitor hits
your site you'll perform a detection to see if the visitor is using a Mobile, 
Tablet, Console etc â€¦ Then either redirect them to a mobile url or optimize 
your site for their device.

API Kits can make requests to our detection servers or they can run stand
alone on your own servers depending on your configuration and which plan 
you've purchased.

API Kit configuration files should be downloaded directly from Handset Detection.
Simply login to your user area, click 'Add a new Site Profile' configure
up your new site then download the appropriate config file for your API Kit.
(There are different config files for each API Kit). 

I hope you enjoy using Handset Detection and if we can help in any way then 
please let us know at hello@handsetdetection.com

Thanks.
